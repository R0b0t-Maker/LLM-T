## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on preference)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Required packages: `transformers`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

### Installation (ToDo)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/LLM-Training-Framework.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:(ToDo)
   ```sh
   cd LLM-Training-Framework
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:(ToDo)
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage(ToDo)
### 1. Data Preprocessing(ToDo)
Prepare your datasets using the `data/preprocessing/` scripts:(ToDo)
```sh
python data/preprocessing/preprocess.py --input data/raw/dataset.csv --output data/processed/dataset.json
```

### 2. Training(ToDo)
Train a model using the `training/trainer.py`:
```sh
python training/trainer.py --config training/config/config.yaml
```
Modify the configuration file to adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, etc.

### 3. Fine-Tuning(ToDo)
Fine-tune a pre-trained model for a specific task:
```sh
python training/fine_tuning.py --model models/base/llm-base --data data/processed/custom_dataset.json
```

### 4. Evaluation(ToDo)
Evaluate a model using custom metrics:
```sh
python evaluation/metrics.py --model models/fine-tuned/llm-custom --test data/processed/test_dataset.json
```

## Practical Codes(ToDo)
Explore the `src/` directory to practice with different LLM and NLP-related scripts:
- **Text Generation**: `src/text_generation.py` demonstrates how to generate text using a pre-trained LLM.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: `src/sentiment_analysis.py` provides an example of using LLMs for sentiment analysis tasks.
- **Prompt Tuning**: `src/prompt_tuning.py` helps you experiment with different prompts and learn how prompt engineering influences LLM outputs.

To run these practical codes:
```sh
python src/text_generation.py --model models/base/llm-base
```

## Useful Papers and Documents
The `documents/` folder contains a collection of papers and references related to LLM and NLP:
- Foundational LLM research papers.
- Practical guides on NLP tasks.
- Advanced papers on prompt engineering, reinforcement learning, and other training strategies.

These documents are valuable for understanding LLMs at a deeper level and staying updated on the latest advancements.

## Advanced Training Techniques(ToDo)
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Code to integrate reinforcement learning into LLM training.
- **Prompt Tuning**: Methods to train prompts effectively to guide the LLM.
- **Transfer Learning**: Apply transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for specific domains.
